          Stories, since inception, have been used to sell millions of products
          to prospects because they work. Here's the truth you don't know:{" "}
          <br />
          Your potential clients won't buy if you list only reasons why they
          should buy from you. You can only sell to them SUCCESSFULLY when their

          their emotions, you need to take them to the moon with relatable
          stories. This is because when your clients are basking in their
          emotional state, they are more likely to take action, remember, and
          connect with you and your products.
